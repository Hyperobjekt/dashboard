  "METRIC_WS_WASTEWATERPROXIMITY": "Waste water proximity (percentile where 0 is the least proximity to waste water and 100 is the most)",
  "UNIT_WS_WASTEWATERPROXIMITY": "percentile",
  "DESC_WS_WASTEWATERPROXIMITY": "Population weighted average of percentile score of wastewater discharge. The wastewater discharge indicator quantifies a block group's relative risk of exposure to pollutants in downstream water bodies. This is achieved using toxicity-weighted concentrations in stream reach segments within 500 meters of a block centroid, divided by distance in meters, aggregated to census tract level.",
